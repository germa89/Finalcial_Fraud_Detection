    "The XGBoost is the solution for the optimization of assemblies of decision trees. It is based on the concept that decision trees can be considered as a function which can be optimized using gradient techniques as any common function. \n",
    "This optimization would be \"measured\" using a loss function. \n",
    "This function is a measure of the error in the predicted values compared with the real values in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm uses the next inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training set: $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}^n_{i=1}$ \n",
    "- Differentiable loss function: $L(y,F(x))$ \n",
    "- Maximum number of iterations: $M$\n",
    "\n",
    "and follows the next steps (From Wikipedia):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the model with random values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_0(x) = \\arg \\min \\sum^n_{i=1} L(y_i, \\gamma)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For m=1 to M:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    2.1. Compute so-called pseudo-residuals:\n",
    "    $$ r_{im} = - \\left[ \\dfrac{\\partial L(y_i,F(x_i))}{\\partial F(x_i)} \\right]_{F(x) = F_{m-1}(x)} \\hspace{3ex} \\text{for i = 1,  ..., n}$$   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2. Fit a base learner (or weak learner e.g. tree) $h_m(x)$ to pseudo-residuals, i.e. train it using the training set.     \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.3. Compute multiplier $\\gamma_m$ by solving the one-dimensional optimization problem:\n",
    "    $$ \\gamma_m = \\arg \\min \\sum^n_{i=1} L(y_i, F_{m-1}(x_i) + \\gamma h_m(x_i))$$   \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.4. Update the model:\n",
    "    $$ F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \\gamma_m h_m(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Output $F_M(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is as it is explained in Wikipedia. However in a more simplistic way, this procedure could be explained as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the model with random values ($x_0$).\n",
    "2. Start iterations until maximum number of iterations is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "    2.1. Calculate the increments in the loss function for the values ($x_m$).  \n",
    "    2.2. Train the decision trees ($h_m(x)$) to fit the increments.  \n",
    "    2.3. Obtain $\\gamma$ from the optimization problem given the trained trees.  \n",
    "    2.4. Update the model ($F_m(x)$).   \n",
    "    \n",
    "It should be noticed that the decision trees are trained on the residual, hence their results $h_m(x)$ are added to the solution in the previous iteration $F_{m-1}(x)$ multiplied by $\\gamma_m$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoiding overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting is the what happens when the model tends to replicate very accurate the training set but it does not perform well on new data. \n",
    "This is considered as a reduction in the generality of the model and it is addressed by using regularization techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shrinkage\n",
    "This consists in adding another multiplier to the $\\gamma_m$ coefficient:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_m(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \\nu \\gamma_m h_m(x)  \\hspace{3ex} 0 < \\nu \\leq 1$$   \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nu$ is called \"learning rate\". \n",
    "\n",
    "This improves substantially the performance the model. Empirically it is demonstrated that values of $\\nu$ lower than 0.1 are the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stochastic gradient boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic gradient boosting take the idea from the bootstrap aggregation (\"bagging\") method. \n",
    "The idea consists on train each of the trees ($h_m(x)$) in a subset of the training set randomly generated without replacement.\n",
    "It has been observed that this improve substantially the model accuracy. \n",
    "The subsample size is represented as a fraction $f$ of the total set. If $f=1$ this improvement is not applied. Practically it has been observed that for moderate or small size dataset, the optimal $f$ values are between 0.5 and 0.8.\n",
    "Since the subsets are smaller, there is generally an improvement in the training speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach might leave out some observations when building the learners (trees). These observation can be used as a validation inside the scheme hence it is not needed a validation set. The error between these leave-out observations and the model predictions is called \"out-of-bag error. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Number of observation in leaves.\n",
    "Ensuring that there is, at least, a minimum number of observations in each of the leaves of the trees is another way to help to regularize the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Penalize tree complexity\n",
    "The complexity of the tree is measured as the number of leaves. Using a suitable pruning approach it might help to reduce the number of leaves by removing leaves or branches that do not contribute to reduce the loss by a threshold. \n",
